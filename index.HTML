  <h2>SUV란?</h2>
  <p>
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle"
  target="_blank" title="suv specification">SUV</a> is <strong>a car <u>classification</u></strong> that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles

  <p style="margin-top:25px;">
    There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV, and usage of the term varies between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars), however, in many cases, crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs. In some countries — such as the United States — SUVs have been classified as "light trucks", resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars.
